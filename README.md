## Wild Wild West Resource Pack

This is my initial Wild Wild West Resource Pack for Vanilla Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.1 or greater.

This is a _minimalist_ folder structure.  Any files missing from this repository have not changed from the Vanilla version of Minecraft; therefore they do not need to be included.  Minecraft will pull all the Vanilla files from the underlying Vanilla resource pack if it cannot find it in this folder structure.

## How to Use

The contents of assets & the pack.mcmeta files need to be zipped together in one folder.  

Open Minecraft and navigate to 'Resource Packs'.  Open up the 'Resource Packs' folder location.  Move the zipped folder into this 'Resource Packs' folder.  

Go back into Minecraft and select the resource pack.  It will load and be present in your world.
